 * @overview
 * The contents of this file will be executed before any of
 * your view controllers are ever executed, including the index.
 * You have access to all functionality on the `Alloy` namespace.
 *
 * This is a great place to do any initialization for your app
 * or create any global variables/functions that you'd like to
 * make available throughout your app. You can easily make things
 * accessible globally by attaching them to the `Alloy.Globals`
 * object. For example:
 *
 * Alloy.Globals.someGlobalFunction = function(){};
